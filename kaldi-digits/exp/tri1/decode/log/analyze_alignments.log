Overall, iu4_E accounts for 1.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,23.9,30) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 55.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 69.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 35.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 25.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (26,37.1,74)
