The optional-silence phone sil occupies 52.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 69.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 33.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 25.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (28,38.4,90)
